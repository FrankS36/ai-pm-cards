## 🎯 What Makes These Cards Different

### 1. Specificity Over Vagueness
**Traditional PM advice**: "Ensure data quality"
**Our cards**: "Sample 200 random examples, manually verify labels. Aim for >95% correct. If lower, retrain labelers or fix guidelines." (EXEC-015)

### 2. Real Numbers & Thresholds
- "1,000+ examples minimum, 10,000+ for production quality" (EXEC-009)
- "P95 latency <500ms" (EXEC-006)
- "If accuracy drops >10%, trigger alert. If >10%, pause feature" (EXEC-040)
- "Budget $0.10-$5 per label depending on complexity" (EXEC-010)
- "Active learning reduces labeling costs by 40-70%" (EXEC-011)

### 3. Failure Modes Included
Every card tells you what can go wrong:
- "Red flag: >10% gap between training and validation metrics means overfitting" (EXEC-020)
- "If humans override >20%, your model needs improvement" (EXEC-008)
- "Shadow mode is expensive (2x compute) but invaluable for risk reduction" (EXEC-034)

### 4. Tool & Framework References
- MLflow, Weights & Biases, Neptune.ai (EXEC-018)
- DVC, LakeFS, Pachyderm (EXEC-012)
- LIME, SHAP for explainability (EXEC-029)
- Optuna, Ray Tune for hyperparameter search (EXEC-049)

## 📚 Sample Cards (Full Content)

### EXEC-001: Write AI Product Specs
**Category**: Requirements & Specs | **Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Description**: Create comprehensive product requirements documents tailored for AI features with probabilistic behaviors.

**When to Use**:
- When scoping a new AI feature before development begins
- When communicating requirements to ML engineers and designers
- Before estimating timelines or resources for AI projects

**Steps**:
1. Define the user problem: What task does AI solve? What's the current painful alternative? Include 3-5 specific user scenarios.
2. Specify success criteria: Model performance thresholds (accuracy, precision, recall), latency limits, cost constraints, user satisfaction targets.
3. Document failure modes: What happens when model is wrong? When it's unsure? When it's slow? Define graceful degradation paths.
4. List edge cases explicitly: Enumerate at least 10 scenarios where AI might fail. How should system behave for each?
5. Define data requirements: Training data volume, labeling needs, refresh frequency, privacy constraints, retention policies.
6. Map dependencies: APIs, infrastructure, monitoring tools, human-in-the-loop processes, fallback systems.

**Pro Tips**:
- Include example inputs and expected outputs for 5 typical cases and 5 edge cases
- Specify what's in scope for MVP vs. future iterations—prevents scope creep

**Related Cards**: Define AI Success Metrics, Write AI Acceptance Criteria, Document Edge Cases & Failure Modes

### EXEC-011: Design Active Learning Workflow
**Category**: Data Strategy | **Difficulty**: Advanced

**Description**: Implement smart sampling strategies that prioritize labeling the most valuable training examples.

**When to Use**:
- When you have large amounts of unlabeled data but limited labeling budget
- When trying to improve model performance efficiently
- When deploying models that learn from production data

**Steps**:
1. Set up uncertainty sampling: Deploy model, capture predictions with confidence scores. Queue low-confidence examples (<70%) for human review.
2. Implement diversity sampling: Don't just label uncertain examples—also sample to cover edge cases and rare scenarios. Use clustering.
3. Create review interface: Show model prediction + confidence, allow labeler to correct or confirm, capture reasoning for corrections
4. Feed labels back: Retrain model weekly or monthly with new labels. Measure if accuracy improves.
5. Balance exploration vs. exploitation: 80% uncertain examples (exploitation), 20% random samples (exploration for coverage)

**Pro Tips**:
- Start active learning after you have 1K baseline labels—need initial model for uncertainty estimates
- Track label efficiency: Are you getting accuracy gains per 100 labels? If not, switch sampling strategy

**Related Cards**: Establish Data Labeling Pipeline, Implement Data Versioning, Define Human-in-the-Loop Requirements

### EXEC-029: Design AI Explanation Interfaces
**Category**: UX & Product Design | **Difficulty**: Advanced

**Description**: Create interfaces that help users understand why AI made specific decisions.

**When to Use**:
- For high-stakes decisions requiring user trust (loans, hiring, medical)
- When regulatory requirements mandate explainability (GDPR, financial services)
- When users frequently question or override AI recommendations

**Steps**:
1. Choose explanation method: Feature importance ('Price and location drove this score'), example-based ('Similar to properties you viewed'), counterfactual ('If price were $50K less, recommendation would change')
2. Match explanation to audience: Non-technical users need simple language, experts can handle technical details. Test comprehension.
3. Show top factors only: Display 3-5 most important factors, not all 50 features. 'Income, credit score, and employment history were most important.'
4. Make explanations actionable: If user can change outcome, tell them how. 'Improve credit score by 50 points to qualify.'
5. Validate accuracy: Ensure explanations reflect actual model logic. Use LIME, SHAP, or other XAI tools. Test edge cases.

**Pro Tips**:
- Simple explanations are often wrong—balance accuracy with understandability
- Let users drill down: Show simple explanation by default, offer 'Technical details' for experts

**Related Cards**: Design Progressive Disclosure, Implement Confidence Score Display

### EXEC-035: Conduct AI Red Teaming
**Category**: Testing & Validation | **Difficulty**: Advanced

**Description**: Simulate adversarial attacks and edge case scenarios to find AI vulnerabilities before users do.

**When to Use**:
- Before launching consumer-facing AI features, especially conversational AI
- For high-stakes applications (content moderation, security, financial decisions)
- When testing robustness of safety guardrails

**Steps**:
1. Recruit red team: Mix of security experts, domain experts, and creative thinkers. External teams find more issues than internal.
2. Define attack scenarios: Prompt injection, jailbreaking, bias exploitation, misinformation generation, adversarial inputs, edge case enumeration
3. Run attack sprints: Give red team 3-5 days to find vulnerabilities. Document all successful attacks with reproduction steps.
4. Triage findings: Severity scoring (critical/high/medium/low). Must-fix before launch vs. acceptable risk vs. post-launch improvement.
5. Implement mitigations: Add input filters, output filters, safety layers, fallback behaviors. Re-test to verify fixes work.

**Pro Tips**:
- Budget $10-50K for external red teaming—finding issues pre-launch is 100x cheaper than post-launch PR disasters
- Run red teaming quarterly for live products—new attack techniques emerge constantly

**Related Cards**: Run Shadow Mode Testing, Execute User Acceptance Testing, Harmful Output Prevention

### EXEC-047: Optimize Model Costs
**Category**: Optimization & Iteration | **Difficulty**: Advanced

**Description**: Reduce inference and training costs while maintaining model quality and user experience.

**When to Use**:
- When AI costs are higher than budgeted or eating into margins
- When scaling to millions of predictions per day
- When stakeholders question AI ROI due to cost concerns

**Steps**:
1. Measure current costs: Break down by training compute, inference compute, data storage, labeling. Identify biggest expense.
2. Optimize inference: Use smaller models, quantization (FP32 to FP16), batching, caching common predictions, use cheaper hardware
3. Reduce training costs: Use transfer learning (fine-tune instead of training from scratch), reduce experiment volume, use spot instances
4. Optimize data costs: Compress datasets, delete old versions, use cheaper storage tiers, reduce labeling through active learning
5. Right-size infrastructure: Use autoscaling, serverless for variable load, reserved instances for predictable load

**Pro Tips**:
- Caching can reduce costs 50-80% for applications with repeated queries—implement early
- Profile costs weekly—gradual creep is harder to fix than sudden spikes

**Related Cards**: Plan Model Retraining, Iterate on AI Features, Optimize Model Performance
