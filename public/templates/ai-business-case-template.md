## Pro Tips for Presenting This

1. **Lead with ROI** - Executives care about payback period first
2. **Use conservative estimates** - Underpromise, overdeliver
3. **Show the "do nothing" cost** - Make inaction expensive
4. **Have 3 scenarios** - Conservative, expected, optimistic
5. **Pre-socialize** - Don't surprise anyone in the meeting
6. **Bring proof points** - Competitor examples, analyst reports
7. **Address FUD upfront** - Fear, uncertainty, doubt about AI
8. **Make it reversible** - Show how you can pivot if it fails
