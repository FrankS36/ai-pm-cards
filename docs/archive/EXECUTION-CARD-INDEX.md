## üí° Pro Tips from the Deck

1. **Always start with baselines** (EXEC-019) - If you can't beat simple rules with ML, you probably don't need ML
2. **Budget 50% of time for data** (EXEC-051) - Data quality matters more than model complexity
3. **Monitor from day 1** (EXEC-040) - Models degrade in production, monitoring isn't optional
4. **Test latency at p95/p99** (EXEC-020) - Average latency hides the experience of real users
5. **Aim for 5-10% feedback rate** (EXEC-043) - Below 2% means your collection mechanism is too hard
6. **Phased rollouts are mandatory** (EXEC-039) - Not optional, even for "simple" features
7. **Include edge cases in specs** (EXEC-004) - Aim for 20-30 documented edge cases minimum
8. **Allocate 30-40% timeline to testing** (EXEC-032) - AI testing takes longer than traditional QA
9. **Re-assess risks monthly for 90 days post-launch** (Risk integration) - Real users reveal hidden risks
10. **Perfect is enemy of shipped** (EXEC-021) - Balance quality with time-to-market
