            <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
            <p>
              Two years ago, I watched a team spend 9 months building an AI recommendation engine for an enterprise product.
              The model was brilliant‚Äî94% accuracy. Launch day: 3% adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem wasn't the algorithm. It was everything else: trust, explainability, user experience,
              progressive disclosure. We rebuilt the UX using frameworks I'd learned shipping AI products at a Fortune 50
              company. 6 weeks later: 47% adoption. Same model, different product thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's when I started documenting what actually works. Not theory‚Äîtactical frameworks from shipping
              AI features to 100K+ users across enterprise products. The patterns that drive adoption, build trust,
              and prevent failures.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI PM Cards is those frameworks. 156 of them, organized into Strategy, Risk, and Execution. Each one
              answers a specific question you'll face when building AI products.
            </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div className="author-bio">
              <p>
                I'm <strong>Frank Sellhausen</strong>, an AI/ML Product Manager leading product initiatives at Dell Technologies.
                Over 5+ years, I've shipped AI features to 100K+ enterprise users and learned what drives adoption (and what kills it).
              </p>
              <p>
                My background combines technical depth with product thinking. I write Python, understand the algorithms,
                and know how to package them into products users trust. That's rare‚Äîmost PMs are one or the other.
              </p>
              <p>
                These frameworks come from real experience: features that flopped, features that scaled, late-night
                debugging sessions, user interviews that changed everything, and launches that taught hard lessons.
              </p>

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
              AI PM Cards is completely free and built with:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>156 frameworks</strong> covering every scenario you'll face</li>
              <li><strong>20 curated learning paths</strong> for different situations</li>
              <li><strong>3 specialized decks:</strong> Strategy, Risk, and Execution</li>
              <li><strong>Battle-tested</strong> frameworks from shipping AI products at scale</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each framework follows a consistent structure: when to use it, step-by-step application,
              pro tips from experience, and related frameworks. No theory, no fluff‚Äîjust what works.
