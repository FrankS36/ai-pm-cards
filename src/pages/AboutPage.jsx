            <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
            <p>
              As a Product Manager at Dell Technologies working on AI/ML products, I kept seeing the same patterns:
            </p>
            <ul className="problem-list">
              <li>Teams shipping AI features that confused users instead of helping them</li>
              <li>PMs treating AI like regular software, missing critical differences</li>
              <li>Risk considerations discovered too late in the development cycle</li>
              <li>Brilliant technical work that never achieved product-market fit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I realized the problem wasn't a lack of information‚Äîit was a lack of <strong>actionable frameworks</strong> at
              the right moment. PMs needed practical, structured approaches they could apply immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I built AI PM Cards: 128 frameworks across Strategy, Risk, and Execution that address the unique
              challenges of AI product management.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div className="author-bio">
              <p>
                I'm <strong>Frank Sellhausen</strong>, a Product Manager at Dell Technologies where I lead AI/ML product initiatives.
                I'm currently pursuing my MBA at Stanford Graduate School of Business (LEAD Program, 2025-2026).
              </p>
              <p>
                My background combines deep technical expertise with strategic product leadership:
              </p>
              <ul className="credentials-list">
                <li><strong>Certifications:</strong> PMP, Certified ScrumMaster, Google UX Design, IDEO Advanced Design Thinking</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Python, Front-End Development, ML/AI, Agile Methodologies</li>
                <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Digital transformation, AI/ML products, empowering high-performing teams</li>
                <li><strong>Military Service:</strong> Leadership training and discipline from military background</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical depth with user-centered design. I don't just understand
                the algorithms‚ÄîI understand how to package them into products people love using.
              </p>
              <p className="philosophy">
                <em>
                  "The best AI products don't showcase their intelligence‚Äîthey make users feel more intelligent."
                </em>

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
              AI PM Cards is a completely free, open resource built with:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>128 cards</strong> covering critical AI PM frameworks</li>
              <li><strong>20 curated paths</strong> for different scenarios and skill levels</li>
              <li><strong>3 decks:</strong> Strategy (discovering opportunities), Risk (addressing challenges), and Execution (shipping successfully)</li>
              <li><strong>Real-world tested</strong> frameworks from actual AI product development</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each card follows a consistent structure: when to use it, the framework itself, step-by-step implementation,
              and pro tips from experience. No fluff‚Äîjust actionable guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entire project is <a href="https://github.com/FrankS36/ai-pm-cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source on GitHub</a> and
              built with React, showcasing both product thinking and technical execution.
