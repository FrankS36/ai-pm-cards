        "Accuracy: % of predictions correct. Good for balanced datasets. Misleading when classes are imbalanced (e.g., 95% negative examples).",
        "Precision: Of positive predictions, % actually positive. High precision = few false alarms. Important when false positives are costly (e.g., spam filtering).",
        "Recall: Of actual positives, % correctly identified. High recall = catch all positives. Important when false negatives are costly (e.g., fraud detection).",
        "F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Use when you need to balance both and classes are imbalanced.",
        "Latency: Time from input to output. P50 (median), p95 (95th percentile), p99. User experience depends on tail latency.",

        "Define agent roles and boundaries: Create one agent per distinct capability. Name them by function (Researcher, Analyst, Writer, Validator). Each agent gets a clear scope: inputs it receives, outputs it produces, and decision authority.",
        "Design handoff protocols: Specify how agents pass information. Use structured formats (JSON schemas, typed objects). Define what happens if an agent fails: retry with same agent, escalate to different agent, or fall back to human.",
        "Establish orchestration logic: Decide on control flow—sequential (Agent A → Agent B → Agent C), parallel (Agents A/B/C run simultaneously), or conditional (Agent A decides which of B/C/D runs next). Use state machines or workflow engines.",
        "Build evaluation per agent: Each agent needs its own success metrics. Don't just measure the final output—track where in the chain quality degrades. Log agent decisions for debugging.",
        "Plan for failure modes: Agents can produce invalid outputs, infinite loops, or conflicting instructions. Set timeouts, output validation, and maximum retry limits. Always have a human-in-the-loop escape hatch."
      ],
      "tips": [
        "Start with 2-3 agents max, not 10. Add complexity only when single-agent approaches fail. Most problems don't need sophisticated orchestration.",
        "Agents aren't microservices. Don't create an agent for every tiny function. Each agent should represent a meaningful capability that users or engineers would recognize as distinct."
