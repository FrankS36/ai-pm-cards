# AI PM Cards - Custom Slash Commands

This directory contains custom slash commands that invoke specialized agents for various tasks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Command Namespace

All commands in this directory require the `/project:` prefix:

‚úÖ **Correct:** `/project:scout-trends what's hot in AI PM`
‚ùå **Wrong:** `/scout-trends what's hot in AI PM`

This is because commands are scoped to prevent naming conflicts between projects.

### Want Global Commands?

To use these commands across ALL projects, copy them to `~/.claude/commands/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp .claude/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

Then use with `/user:` prefix: `/user:scout-trends`, `/user:audit-ux`, etc.

## Creating New Commands

To create a new slash command, add a markdown file to this directory:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this command does
---

The command prompt that will be executed...

[User input area]: [Description of what user should provide]
```

**Naming Convention:**
- Use kebab-case: `command-name.md`
- Be descriptive: `audit-ux.md` not `ux.md`
- Group by function: `generate-*`, `audit-*`, `fix-*`

---

## Tips

1. **Be Specific:** The more specific your command input, the better the agent output
   - ‚ùå `/audit-ux the site`
   - ‚úÖ `/audit-ux Card.jsx flip animation for motion sensitivity`

2. **Chain Commands:** Use output from one command to inform the next
   - `/project:scout-trends` ‚Üí `/project:generate-cards` ‚Üí `/project:review-content` ‚Üí `/project:audit-ux`

3. **Iterate:** You can refine agent outputs by providing feedback
   - "Make those error messages less technical"
   - "Add more specific examples to those cards"

4. **Save Context:** Agents don't remember previous conversations
   - Include relevant context in each command invocation
   - Reference specific file paths, card IDs, or user flows

---
